[x] add "save" to the webview that saves svg (default) or png as an alternative with .diagram source as metadata (not visible to the user, but we can always redraw and edit the svg based on the .diagram content)
[x] add "open" to the webview that imports an svg that has .diagram source in the metadata and opens it in the editor
