[] add possibility to select multiple nodes with the mouse by holding click and dragging a rectangle around them. This is a common feature in diagramming tools and would enhance usability when managing complex diagrams. I should be able to move them together when  clicking and dragging any of the selected nodes. The group is cleared once mouse clicks on an empty area of the canvas or clicks on a non-selected node.
[] when moving a node, it should snap to a grid, also to snap to lines with other nodes (e.g. align tops, centers, bottoms). This would help users create neater diagrams without needing to manually align everything.
[] analyze how are nodes aligned in architecture.diagram in sarah-ai project (top down), without edge crossing, and try to implement a similar auto-layout algorithm that can be triggered by the user to automatically arrange nodes in a clear and organized manner. This would be especially useful for larger diagrams where manual arrangement becomes cumbersome. Also aligne nodes to a grid and other nodes lines when auto-layout is triggered. Maintain same distance between nodes when auto-layout is triggered, to avoid cluttered diagrams.
[] parse the current ideas.md, think about what else can be improved or added and extend that .md file
