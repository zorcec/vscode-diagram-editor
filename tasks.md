[] user should be able to unpin the node
[] user should be able to force auto-layout (also pinned nodes)
[] add few smoke tests for the extension (e.g. create a diagram, add nodes/edges, trigger layout, check for errors). Make sure it is not flaky, and not too slow. Goal is to have all e2e executed under 1m if possible.
